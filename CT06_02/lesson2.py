# Lesson 2 - Introduction to Pseudocode

## Recap 1: Colours of the Rainbow
# Task: 
# 1. Using a new line for each colour, print out the 7
#    colours of the rainbow.
# 2. Then, comment out every other line except for your
#    favourite colour.
# print('red')
# print("orange")
# print("yellow")
print("green")
# print("blue")
# print("indigo")
# print("violet")


# --------------------------------------------------------

## Task 1: Solve the problem in pseudocode
# **Task 1a**:
# Task: Look at the screen and translate the code blocks
# into pseudocode

#say hey 1 time
# step forward 10 times
# repeat 10 times

# repeat 10 times:
#   say "hey!"
#   step forward 10 times


# **Task 1b**:
# Task: Look at the screen and translate the code blocks
# into pseudocode

# set variable "counter" to 0
# while variable "counter" is not 50
#   step forward 10 times
#   turn 15 degrees
#   add to variable "counter" by 10

# **Task 1c**:
# Task: Look at the screen and translate the code blocks
# into pseudocode

# ask "What is your age" and assign to "answer"
# if answer is less than 18 then
#   say "access denied"
# if answer is over 18 then
#   say "Welcome"

# ## Task 2: Recycling Logic
# Task: Write down the steps on how to solve the problem below

# Design pseudocode for a recycling robot that sorts items
# into bins for glass, plastic, and paper. The robot should
# check each item's material and place it in the correct bin.

# if item's material is glass then
#   put it in glass bin
# if item"s material is plastic then
#   put it in plastic bin
# if item's material is paper then
#   put it in paper bin

# ## Task 3: What's the password?
# Task: Using pseudocode, design a program that will check if the
# user has entered the right secret phrase.

# 1. If the user has entered a wrong secret phrase, send them an
# error message.
# 2. If the user has entered the right secret phrase, congratulate
# them.

# set "answer" to "secretlolipop"
# ask "what's the password" and assign to "User input"
# if "user input" is not the same as "answer" then
#   say "access denied"
# if "user input" is the same as"answer" then
#   say "welcome"
# --------------------------------------------------------

# ## Task 4: What's your grade?
# Task: Write a pseudocode that calculates the final score of a student
# based on the following weightage:
# _each test is scored upon 100_
# Test 1 = 20%
# Test 2 = 40%
# Test 3 = 40%

# set "test 1" to 20% of test 1
# set "test 2" to 40% of test 2
# set "test 3" to 40% of test 3
# student final score = test 1 + test 2 + test 3
