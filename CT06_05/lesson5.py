# Lesson 5 - Introduction to For Loop and range()

## Recap 1: Automated Birthday Invitation

# You run a small business that creates personalized digital
# birthday invitation cards. To automate the process, you decide
# to write a Python program. 

# This program should ask the user for:
# 1. birthday person's name
# 2. the age that they are turning that year
# 3. personal message from the sender

# Finally, the program prints out a personalized invitation
# message.

# ### Sample output:
# "Happy <Age>th birthday <Name>! <Message>"

# name = input("what is your name? ")
# age = input("how old are you this year? ")
# message = input("what is the message you want to send? ")
# print("happy " + age + "th birthday " + name + "! " + message)

## Task 1: Repeated Sentence Loop

# Print the sentence "I like chicken rice." 100 times using the
# 'for' loop

# for i in range(100):
#     print("i like chicken rice")

## Task 3: Sentence Repetition Loop with Order of Code
##         Sequence

# Using the 'for' loop, print the following sentences sequence
# 100 times:
# "I like cake."
# "Give me more"


# for i in range(100):
#     print("i like cake")
#     print("give me more")



# print 100 to 1

# for count in range(100, 0, -1):
#     print(count)

# **Task 5a**:
# Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a 'for' loop.

# for i in range(1, 6):
#     print(i)

# **Task 5b**:
# Print numbers from 51 to 100 using a 'for' loop.

# for i in range(51, 101):
#     print(i)

# **Task 5c**:
# Print numbers from 18 to 29 using a 'for' loop.

# for i in range(18, 30):
#     print(i)

# ## Task 6: range(start, stop, step)

# **Task 6a**:
# Use a 'for' loop to print numbers from 2 to 24 in multiples of 2.

# for i in range(2, 25, 2):
#     print(i)


# **Task 6b**:
# Use a 'for' loop to print numbers from 8 to 96 in multiples of 8.

# for i in range(8, 97, 8):
#     print(i)

# **Task 6c**:
# Use a 'for' loop to print numbers from 5 to 1 in descending order.

# for i in range(5, 0, -1):
#     print(i)

# **Task 6d**: # Use a 'for' loop to print odd numbers from 51 to -35 in descending order.

# for i in range(51, -36, -2):
#     print(i)

## Task 7: Countdown timer

# **Task 7a**:
# Imagine you are the race official and to start the race, you
# must say the following:

#     Ready!
#     3
#     2
#     1

# Using a 'for' loop, recreate the above sequece
# print("Ready!")
# for i in range(3, 0, -1):
#     print(i)
# **Task 7b**:
# Create a countdown timer that counts from 10 to 1.
# When the timer hits 1, print "Boo!"

# for i in range(10, 0, -1):
#     print(i)
# print("Boo!")


## Task 8: User-Defined Range Counter

# Using input(), ask the user for 2 numbers and store them in the
# variables:
# 1. start
# 2. stop

# Write a 'for' loop to count from **start** to **stop**

# Note:
# What happens if the user inputs a higher start number than stop?
# Modify your code to be able to handle that scenario.
# start = int(input("give me a start number"))
# end = int(input("give me a stop number"))

# for i in range(start, end, step):
#     print(i)
## Task 9: Accumulative Sum in Loop

# 1. Create a variable 'num' and assign the integer "0" to it
# 2. Create a 'for' loop that repeats 10 times
# 3. Add the sum of 'num' and the loop's parameter and print out
#    the value.
# 4. Observe what happens.

num = 0
for i in range(10):
    num = num + i
    print(num)
# 0
# 0 + 1
# 0 + 1 + 2
# ...
#  0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + 9

# 1 + 3 + 5 + .. + 21
num = 0
for i in range(1, 21, 2):
    num = num + i
    print(num)

## Task 9: Name Cheer

# Your school's Sports Day is coming up and you are coding a
# program to cheer your schoolmates up.

# Your program needs to:
# 1. Using input(), ask the user for their namee e.g. <Dave>
# 2. Print a cheer as shown below:
   
#     ### Example:
#     What is your name? [Input: "Dave"]
#     Give me a D!
#     Give me a a!
#     Give me a v!
#     Give me a e!
#     What do we have?
#     Dave is the best!

# Note:
#     Notice how "Give me a..." is repeated!
#     Which function should you be using?
# name = input("what is your name? ")
# for char in name:
#     print("give me a " + char)
# print("who do we have?")
# print(name + " is the best!" )

# 3 + 8 + 13 + ... + 33
num = 0
for i in range(3, 33, 5):
    num = num + i
    print(num)
