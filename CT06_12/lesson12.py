# # Lesson 12 - While Loops

# # Recap 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
# Create a program to check if a number is both divisible by 3
# and 5.

# 1. Ask the user to input a number
# 2. Using the '%' operator, check if the number is both a
#    multiple of 3 and 5:
#     If true, print "The number is divisible by 3 and 5!"
# 3. Else, print "The number is not divisible by 3 and 5"

# number = int(input("Give me a number "))

# if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
#     print("The number is divisible by 3 and 5!")
# else:
#     print("The number is not divisible by 3 and 5!")

# # Task 1: Introduction to while loop
# **Task 1a**:
# Due to a pandemic, the government placed a limit to the number
# of visitors a venue can have.

# Using a 'while' loop, create a program that will increase the
# number of visitors by 1 before printing out the number of
# visitors admitted, until number of visitors reaches 50.

# 1. Create a 'visitors' variable and assign '0' to it
# 2. While there is less than 50 visitors,
#     I. Increase the visitor count by 1
#     II. Print the visitor count

# visitors = 0

# while visitors < 50:
#     visitors += 1
#     print(f"The number of visitors is: {visitors}")
    
# (For Task 1b & 1c)
# Modify your program to account for the number of visitors
# already present at the venue, and the number of maximum visitors
# allowed for the following:

# **Task 1b**:
# Visitors already present: 18
# Max visitors allowed: 30

# visitors = 18

# while visitors < 30:
#     visitors += 1
#     print(f"Visitors already present: {visitors}")

# if visitors == 30:
#     print(f"Max visitors allowed: 30")
# **Task 1c**:
# Visitors already present: 4
# Max visitors allowed: 25

# visitors = 4

# while visitors < 25:
#     print(f"visitors already present: {visitors}")
#     visitors += 1
#     if visitors == 25:
#         print("Max visitors allowed: 25")


# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# # Task 2: while... break
# A restaurant used to have a max capacity of 50. However, due to
# the worsening of the pandemic, the government has restricted the
# max capacity of the restaurant to 30.

# Using an 'if' condition and 'break' within the 'while' loop,
# modify your answer for Task 1a to terminate the 'while' loop when
# # number of visitors is 30.
# visitors = 0

# while True:
#     visitors += 1
#     print(f"The number of visitors is: {visitors}")
#     if visitors == 30:
#         print("Max number of people is 30.")
#         break
        
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# # Task 3: Order taking using while loop
# Using what you have learnt so far, code a program to take a
# customer's order.

# Declare a variable called 'order' and assign an empty string
# variable "" to it.

# Using a 'while' loop:
# 1. Ask the user to enter their order
# 2. For each order entered, concatenate to the 'order' variable.
# 3. Exit the 'while' loop if the user enters "end"
# 4. On program end, print out the customer's order.
# order = ""

# while True:
#     customer = input("What is the order? :")
#     # write the exit condition first
#     if customer == "end":
#         break
#     if order != "":
#         order += ","
#     order += customer

# print(order)

# use the while condition
# order = ""
# customer = ""
# while customer != "end":
#     customer = input("What is the order: ")
#     if customer != "end":
#         order += customer + ","
# print(order)
    
# **Bonus**
# 1. Modify your code to remove the comma (",") that appears
#    either at the start or end of your sentence

# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# # Task 4: while... else
# The else condition will run when the loop exits normally.
# i.e. when the while condition is no longer true.

# Using 'else', create a program that will count from 10 to 1,
# before printing "Happy New Year!"

# **Task 4a**:
# Using a 'while' loop:
# 1. Print the numbers from 10 to 1
# 2. Once count reaches 1, use 'else' to print
#    "Happy New Year!"
# count = 10
# while count != 0:
#     print(count)
#     count = count -1
# else:
#     print("Happy New Year!")

# **Task 4b**:
# Now, modify your 'while' loop from Task 4a such that:
# 1. If the number is 5, 'break' out of the loop
# 2. Ensure your code has an 'else'

# Observe that "Happy New Year!" is no longer printed
# count = 10
# while count != 0:
#     print(count)
#     count = count -1
#     if count == 5:
#         break
# else:
#     print("Happy New Year!")
# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# # Task 5: Math Question
# **Task 5a**:
# Create a program to test the user on their math skills! The
# program will continue generating new questions until the user
# get the correct answer.

# 1. Using a 'while' loop, 
# 2. Generate 2 random numbers between 1 and 10 (import 'random'
#    and use 'random.randint()')
# 3. Ask the user to add the 2 numbers together in the following
#    format:
#     "What is 3 + 5?"
# 4. If the user gets the correct answer:
#     Print "That's correct!
# 5. Else:
#     print "Wrong! Try again"
#     End the 'while' loop
# import random

# num_1 = random.randint(1, 10)
# num_2 = random.randint(1, 10)
# ans = num_1 + num_2

# # while condition
# user_ans = int(input(f"What is {num_1} + {num_2}? "))
# while user_ans != ans:
#     print("wrong! Try again")
#     user_ans = int(input(f"What is {num_1} + {num_2}? "))
# print("The answer is correct")

# while user_ans != ans:
#     print("wrong! Try again")
#     break
# else:
#     if user_ans == ans:
#         print("Correct")
#         break
# **Bonus**
# Some ideas to improve on the above program:
# 1. Print the user's score once the game is over
# 2. Randomly choose an operator for each question: + - *

# **Task 5b**:
# Modify your answer from Task 5a to keep asking a new
# question until the user get 5 correct answers.

# implement chances for each qns , give 2 chances to answer for each qns, if used up, go to the next qns
# correct_ans = 0
# import random

# while correct_ans != 5:
#     chance = 2
#     num_1 = random.randint(1, 10)
#     num_2 = random.randint(1, 10)
#     ans = num_1 + num_2
#     user_ans = int(input(f"What is {num_1} + {num_2}? "))
#     while user_ans != ans and chance > 1:
#         print("wrong! Try again")
#         chance -= 1
#         print(f"You have {chance} left.")
#         user_ans = int(input(f"What is {num_1} + {num_2}? "))
#     # if chance == 0:
#     #     print("You lose!")
#     #     break
#     if user_ans == ans and chance > 0:
#         correct_ans += 1
#         print("The answer is correct")
#         print(f"You have {correct_ans} correct answers!")


# **Bonus**
# Some ideas to improve on the above program:
# 1. Add a score system (+2 for right answer, -1 for wrong answer)
# 2. Add an ability for users to skip by saying "skip"
# 3. Disqualify user when they have gotten the wrong answer or
#    skipped more than 5 times.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# # Task 6: Dice Roll till 4
# Using 'while' loop and the 'random.randint()' function from the
# 'random' library, constantly print a random number between 1 and
# 6 until the random number generated is 4.

# 1. Import the 'random' library
# 2. Create 'num' variable and assign it '0'
# 3. While 'num' variable is not '4',
#     a. Using 'random.randint()', assign 'num' variable a random
#        number between 1 and 6.
#     b. Print the random number generated.
num = 0
counter = 0
import random
number = int(input("What is the number that you want to roll? "))
while num != number:
    num = random.randint(1,6)
    counter += 1
    print(num)
    if num == number:
        print(f"It took {counter} rolls to get {number}")
# **Bonus**
# Some ideas to improve on the above program:
# 1. Add a counter variable and announce the number of tries it
#    took before rolling a '4'.
# 2. Add the ability for the user to determine which number to roll
#    until (instead of '4' all the time).
# 3. Break out of the 'while' loop if counter variable reaches 10
#    and print "You have won the jackpot!"
